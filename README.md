# Black history month api

- This API features 110 people in honor of black history month.

## Running

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/SankThomas/black-history-month-api.git`
2. You will need `json-server` installed in order to see it in action. You can do this by running `npm install -g json-server` which will install it globally.
3. Open the cloned repository and run `json-server --watch db.json` and it should open up the API on `https://localhost:3000/people`
